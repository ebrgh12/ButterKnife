# ButterKnife

An application which makes use of ButterKnife View injection library in Android.

We make use of annotations to simplify and reduce our code.

1.@BindView- To Bind the views(Instead of findViewById which we used to find the views)

2.@OnClick- To set the onclick listners insted of using setOnclickListner.


I personally like this library as it reduces unwanted code and makes development easy.
